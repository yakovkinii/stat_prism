# Development roadmap

## Early evaluation (v0.5) 

### Required features for early evaluation:
 
* [ ] Delete results
* [ ] Save/load reports
* [ ] Export/copy reports
* [x] Fully restore correlations 
* [x] Minimally restore descriptives
* [ ] Add filters
* [ ] Refactor the modules
* [ ] Ask to save and delete results on opening a new file
* [ ] Handle mixed types in the data
* [x] Find a solution for HTML-related CTD

### Optional features for early evaluation:

* [ ] Color column selector according to the column category
* [ ] Custom column inversion calibration
* [x] <s>Reimplement verbal results for descriptive statistics</s>. To be implemented after unfreezing.

### Early evaluation feedback focus

* User interface: layout and general usability
* User interface: color scheme and design
* Feature-completeness of correlations
* Any bugs or crashes
* Any manual adjustments left over

## Unfreezing (v0.6) 

### Required features before unfreezing:

* [ ] Group column values into custom categories
* [ ] Add plots and plot tools
* [ ] Unify result styles


### Checklist for unfreezing

* [ ] Descriptives and correlations are fully functional and feature-complete
* [ ] Project structure is sound and modular

---

## Closed alpha (v0.8):

* [ ] Undo functionality
* [ ] All basic analyses (ANOVA, EFA, CFA, etc.)
