# Development roadmap

## Early evaluation (v0.5) 

### Required features for early evaluation:
 
* <s>Delete results</s>
* <s>Save/load reports</s>
* <s>Export/copy reports</s>
* <s>Fully restore correlations</s> 
* <s>Minimally restore descriptives</s>
* Add filters
* <s>Ask to save and delete results on opening a new file</s>
* <s>Handle mixed types in the data</s>
* <s>Find a solution for HTML-related CTD</s>

### Optional features for early evaluation:

* Color column selector according to the column category
* Custom column inversion calibration
* <s>Reimplement verbal results for descriptive statistics</s>
* Add correlation plots
* Refactor the modules

### Early evaluation feedback focus

* User interface: layout and general usability
* User interface: color scheme and design
* Feature-completeness of correlations
* Any bugs or crashes
* Any manual adjustments left over

---

## Unfreezing (v0.6) 

### Required features before unfreezing:

* Group column values into custom categories
* Add plots and plot tools
* Unify result styles


### Checklist for unfreezing

* Descriptives and correlations are fully functional and feature-complete
* Project structure is sound and modular

---

## Closed alpha (v0.8):

* Undo functionality
* All basic analyses (ANOVA, EFA, CFA, etc.)
